"""Kaggriculture — a simple, complete baseline agent.

A complete, readable agent: hires hands, keeps every unit on a nearest-task
schedule, plants/waters/harvests carrots and wheat, walks produce back to the
shed, drip-sells, and liquidates at the end. Beats `starter` ~20x.

Deliberately simple: no market modelling, no livestock. The structure is the
part to keep; the decisions inside it are the part to improve.
